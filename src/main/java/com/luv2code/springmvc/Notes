Spring Testing Support
For testing Spring REST controllers, you can use MockMvc
. Provides Spring REST processing of request / response
There is no need to run a server (embedded or external)
In general, the process is VERY similar to Spring MVC testing
Slight differences for content-type and checking JSON results


# Controller Test Structure

// inject support utils
// inject Service and DAOS
// inject SQL strings
// @Before All, BeforeEach and @AfterEach


Json Path Examples

eg-Json is
$->{
$.id->"id":10,
$.firstname->"firstname":"dds",
...

}

$  -> The root element to query.Starts all path expression
$.id -> Access the id element of JSON element
$.firstname -> Access the firstname element of JSON element
